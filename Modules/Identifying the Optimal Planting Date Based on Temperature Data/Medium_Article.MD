**Identifying the Optimal Planting Date Based on Temperature Data**

**Introduction**

In the field of agriculture, identifying the optimal planting date is crucial for maximizing crop yield and ensuring the success of a farming operation. One non-obvious insight that can be extracted from historical temperature data is determining the average date range during which temperatures consistently reach above 50°F for at least five consecutive days. This insight could inform farmers' decisions about when to plant their crops, ensuring the crops have the best possible conditions for germination and growth. The code discussed in the assignment can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ASM443/Data-Science-Techniques/blob/main/Modules/Identifying%20the%20Optimal%20Planting%20Date%20Based%20on%20Temperature%20Data/Weather.ipynb).

**Data Description**

The data that could answer this question includes daily minimum temperature records for a specific location over multiple years. This data is relevant because it allows us to identify trends in temperature patterns and determine when the soil temperature is likely to be warm enough to support plant growth. The data used in this analysis is sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Data Online (CDO) system, which provides access to a wide range of climate and weather data.

**Data Collection**

To collect the data, the Python library 'requests' was used to interact with NOAA's CDO API. The API allows users to retrieve temperature data for specific locations and time ranges. In this analysis, I focused on daily minimum temperatures from March 1st to July 1st for the years 2002 to 2022 in College Park, Maryland. This time range was chosen because it covers the typical planting season for many crops in the Northern Hemisphere.

**Exploratory Data Analysis**

The collected temperature data was analyzed to identify periods of five consecutive days with temperatures above 50°F. For each year, the first date that met this criterion was recorded. Then, the average date for all years was calculated. This provided a general idea of the optimal planting date based on historical temperature data.

**Data Cleaning and Common Bugs**

Before analyzing the data, some cleaning and preprocessing were necessary. This involved converting the date strings to datetime objects, filtering out repeating data, since the API returned the minimum temperature twice for each day. One common bug encountered during this process was plotting the data. If the data was plotted with the full dates on the y-axis(04-17-2008) matplotlib would just print a 90° line which was incorrect. The solution I found was to make another column in the dataframe called “dummy_date” where all the dates had the same year but the x-axis had the correct year displayed.

**Results**

The exploratory data analysis revealed that the average optimal planting date based on the temperature criterion was around May 1st. A scatter plot was created to visualize the relationship between years and the first date that met the temperature criterion. The plot showed a general trend of the optimal planting date occurring slightly later in more recent years.

**Limitations and Bias:**

There are several limitations to this analysis. First, the temperature criterion of 50°F for five consecutive days is a simplification of the complex factors affecting plant growth. Soil temperature, moisture, and other environmental factors play a role in determining the optimal planting date. The metric used to find optimal planting date was also estimated, frost generally occurs below 50°F but some plants may survive. For instance, 5 consecutive days of 49°F or 4 consecutive days of 50°F may be equivalent to the criterion used in this analysis. Another limitation is the potential for bias in the data. The temperature records may be influenced by various factors, such as the presence of weather stations and the accuracy of their measurements. Furthermore, the analysis only considers a 20-year time frame, which might not be representative of long-term climate trends.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, this analysis provides a starting point for understanding the relationship between temperature patterns and optimal planting dates. Although the results should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations mentioned above, they offer valuable insights for farmers and agricultural stakeholders in making informed decisions about planting schedules. Further research could expand the analysis to include other climate variables, additional locations, and a longer time frame to enhance the robustness of the findings.
